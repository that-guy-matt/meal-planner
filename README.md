====== Automatic Meal Planning App ======

===== About the Project =====

This project aims to aid in creating a weekly meal plan. I often have trouble thinking what to eat throughout the week. I thought it would be helpful to have an application that makes some random suggestions.

The application simply gets a random recipe from TheMealDB and is displayed on the page with an image, ingredients, and instructions.

It is simple, but I plan this to be a long term project that I will flesh out into a more robust and featured application.

===== Built With =====

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TheMealDB API

===== Roadmap =====

Right now, this application produces only a single randomly chosen meal recipe. The following features are currently planned:

- 7 meal menu design/layout
- Printable menu
- Printable grocery list
- Ability to reject individual meals and receive a random replacement

===== Known Issues =====
